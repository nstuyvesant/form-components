# Vue 3 Form Components
FormGroup and FormInput components that provide flexible validation written in TypeScript using the Vue 2.6.11's Composition API. If any FormInputs have a validation error, validation errors will be displayed and the FormGroup will not fire the submit event.

Based on Anthony Gore's article https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2020/03/31/vue-js-form-composition-api/ with some ideas from Vue Formulate's FormulateForm https://vueformulate.com/guide/forms/#setting-initial-values.
